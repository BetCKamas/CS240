Here is a story about the letter D. To make uppercase D, you start here and make a line down. Then you start at the top and make a curve
 like this. To make lowercase d, go all the way around like this, then make a line that goes straight down. Some things that start with D
 are . . . duck, dinosaur, doughnut. Okay, now here’s our story. Once there was a duck. His name was Doughy. He lived in a den. Doughy
 loved desserts, especially doughnuts and danishes. One day, Doughy the duck discovered a door in his den he’d never seen before. As he
 stepped through, the door closed behind him. He couldn’t unlock it. It was very dark, but he could see a dim light. When he found the
 light, he saw dinosaur. She was wearing a dress and was digging in the dirt. Doughy said, What are you doing? And the dinosaur said,
 Oh, hi. I’m Dorothy. I’m so hungry. I’m looking for dinner. Doughy said, Dinner is not down there. Then he gets an idea. But if you
 help me get back to my den, I will help you get some dinner. So, they went back to the door, and Dorothy the dinosaur had an idea. We
 could use this diamond to drill through the door! And it worked! Back in the den, they had dinner. Then they had lots of doughnuts and
 danishes for dessert. Delicious! The end. D What D words did you find in the story?
